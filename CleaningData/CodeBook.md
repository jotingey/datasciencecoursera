#Variables include
Subject : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
Activity : The type of motion the Subject was performing at the time the measurements were recorded.  6 possible Activities per Subject including WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The data from the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset' was used to estimate the Average for each mean and standard deviation calculated for each measurement by subject and Activity.
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
These measurements were initial normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
Angular Velocity was measured in radians/second
Acceleration was measured in standard gravity units 'g'
